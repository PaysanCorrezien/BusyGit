# Git Tracker TUI

Git Tracker TUI is a terminal user interface (TUI) application built with Python and the Textual library. It allows users to monitor multiple Git repositories, either by specifying individual repositories or by watching directories containing multiple repositories. The application uses a configuration file to store the list of directories and repositories to monitor.

## Features

- **Directory Monitoring**: Watch specified directories for Git repositories.
- **Individual Repository Monitoring**: Monitor specific Git repositories.
- **Configuration File**: Use a TOML or YAML file to store the list of directories and repositories to monitor.
- **XDG Path Support**: Store configuration files in XDG-compliant directories.
- **User Interface**: Provide a TUI for easy interaction and monitoring.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Textual library
- PyYAML or TOML library for configuration file parsing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-tracker-tui.git
   cd git-tracker-tui
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install textual pyyaml toml
   ```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file in the XDG-compliant directory (e.g., `~/.config/git-tracker-tui/config.yaml` or `~/.config/git-tracker-tui/config.toml`).

Example YML configuration:
```yaml
directories:
  - ~/repos
  - ~/projects
repositories:
  - ~/.config/nvim
```

Example TOML configuration:
```toml
directories = ["~/repos", "~/projects"]
repositories = ["~/.config/nvim"]
```

## Usage

Run the application using:
```bash
python git_tracker_tui.py
```

## Development Tasks

1. **Setup Project Structure**: Initialize a Python project with necessary directories and files.
2. **Implement Configuration Parsing**: Write functions to read and parse the configuration file using PyYAML or TOML.
3. **Directory and Repository Monitoring**: Implement logic to identify and monitor Git repositories in specified directories.
4. **Build TUI whith Textual**: Design and implement the TUI using the Textual library.
5. **XDG Path Integration**: Ensure configuration files are stored and accessed using XDG-compliant paths.
6. **Testing**: Write tests to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
7. **Documentation**: Document the code and provide user guides.
